Testing hyperapp, seems cool :D

See https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp

## How to start it

If you have npm, issue a `npm i` and then `npm run serve` to start the development server. It will listen on port 8081.

If you have Docker and make, then start `make build` to prepare the base image, `make npmi` to install packages and `make run` to start the development server. Webpack listen port is mapped to 8081 in the `Makefile`.
